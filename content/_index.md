Aamir and I founded Esanjo as our take on what we felt a technology business should be. We're very big believers in the right culture and working with like-minded people. At the same time, we're opinionated, don't really like events (but are happy
  to come out on occasion) and will do anything that we can to get out of the the curse of meetings. We love building stuff that people find useful, but more importantly also make them feel happy. We like interesting things, don't like administrative
  stuff, but also like being organised.

We're still discovering what exactly Esanjo is, but are happy to take our time to do so. We're a small team that's kicked off a few experiments, invested a bit of money whilst also kicking off a few ideas that may turn into interesting ventures.

If you like uncertainty and recognise that the only real constant is change,

Over the last few years, we realised that most organisations build policies for what we call
  <strong>“the 2%”</strong>, those individuals who have a tendency towards disruption and therefore need rules to govern their organisational behaviour. Unfortunately this leads to long documents that no one reads (until there’s a problem) and a
  complicated set of policies that the other 98% have to live by. More rules isn’t the right solution.

We deliberately decided that we’re building an organisation that is based on trust, transparency and accountability (and 11 other values that you can read more about here:
  <a href="/about/core-values/" class="highlight">Core Values</a>). You’ll either love the way we work, or you won’t. There typically isn’t a middle ground. We do things really well or we don’t. We push hard to bring the right individuals to the table
  and measure them on outcomes rather than hours worked (or run inane reports on how many hours you spent signed into your machine yesterday).

After exiting our last business, we realised that we needed to continuously codify our collective knowledge to be able to build an effective, globally distributed organisation. The result is a living, breathing handbook that describes how we run
  and work at Esanjo.

Contained within, you’ll find all the policies and processes that we use at Esanjo, representing many years of thinking, research and experience as well as some serious introspection. It isn’t perfect, but we think it’s a great starting point.

We’re
  <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/" class="highlight">open sourcing all of it</a>, so please feel free to fork it and use anything or everything, and to modify them as you see fit. We hope that by publishing them, other companies can benefit from our research and make their own policies more inclusive.

If all of this sound like a place where you’d like to work, we’re always hiring. Check out our current openings at
