All written and spoken communication related to our work is done in English. This is so that all relevant parties can understand what's being discussed.

**Slack Instant Messaging**

At Esanjo, we use Slack for our internal communication. We don't send internal emails unless it's necessary.  It is strongly encouraged that you use public channels to discuss work related matters. Each team has their own public channel, you can join any channel to see what each team is doing. The top channels you should join is #general, #random #whereabouts and your office location's channel. That will be #dubai for Dubai and #colombo for Colombo.

**Slack calls**

If chatting is not enough to discuss with your teammates, Slack has calls and video calls available to use to make a call. You just click on the telephone icon on the Slack window of the person you want to call and take it from there.

**Blue Jeans**

For large group meetings or company-wide announcements, we use Blue Jeans to do cross functional meetings and announcements regarding the company.

**Screen Hero**

For calls where screen sharing is needed, we use Screen Hero.

**Appear**

Appear is another web-based video call application that we use for communicating between teams. The application does not require sign ups or sign-ins. All you have to do is to create a room, share the link of the room to the parties involved in the video call and start the call.


**Your JP email**

Emails are mainly used to communicate externally with other companies, clients, and vendors.

**Toky**

We have decided to remove landlines in 2016 and we're now using Toky to call out to buyers, sellers and other relevant stakeholders.
