We run our calls every week on a Tuesday at 11AM UAE time, The call currently takes place on Slack and is usually run by me (Aamir) giving a general weekly update with what's going on. Following the call notes are put up on the [#general](https://esanjo.slack.com/) channel on Slack.

## Changes to the call Structure from June onwards:

The following extracted from part of our weekly call on the 19th of June 2018 from [Slack](https://esanjo.slack.com/archives/C63E39KK7/p1529573564000479)

- The fist big change is that I will be picking from *one or two people* every week on the Monday (a day before the call) to update what’s been going on in their department and any other awesome stuff that they want to share. It doesn’t have to be long and it gives everyone a chance to share updates. Try and include something cool in there!
- There is also a new card on Asana with all previous update notes. The reason being; it’s cool to go back and see what we’ve worked on as well as if anyone new comes on-board they can also see our awesome journey. The card is [here](https://goo.gl/37VU7F)
