This guide needs to be updated to include G Suite's new processes.

We use Google's G Suite for email and to collaborate on documents via Google Drive. This quick guide explains how and administrator can set up a new email address on G Suite.

## 1. Create a new user
![1]

Fill our the new user's details. We follow a [FirstName].[LastName]@esanjo.com convention.

Pick an easy to remember temporary password over 16 characters. The user will change this out when they sign in for the first time.

Hit the "Create" button to create the new user.

## 2. Send the user an email
![2]

Once the new user has been created, use the confirmation screen to send them an email with the details of their new account to the email address on file on the user's Bamboo HR profile.

![3]

Ensure that you send a copy to yourself.

## 3. Send the user a proper email welcome!

When you receive the copy of the email, forward it back to the user at their new Esanjo address using the template below. The intention is to give the user a bit more detail than a generic G Suite welcome email.

Subject: Welcome to Esanjo!

Hey [FirstName],

Welcome to Esanjo! I've set up an email address for you :)

Your new email address is FirstName.LastName@esanjo.com
Your temporary password is: esanjo123esanjo123

1. Before you do anything else, please sign in and change your password at: https://myaccount.google.com/

2. Please set your email signature by generating it here: http://jdp.do/jpsignature

Welcome aboard! Please ping me via Slack should you have any queries!

Kind Regards,

[YourFirstName]

[Note: We probably should customise this template in the future and add links to the Esanjo Way as well as other relevant onboarding links]
