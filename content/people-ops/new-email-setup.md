Before your start date, the People Operations Specialist will create an email address for you. You should receive an email with the login details.

To set it up:

1. Login to your Esanjo email address with the credentials you received from the People Operations Specialist
2. Change your password through the link in the email
3. Make sure that 2-factor authentication is activated
4. Generate your email signature through the link specified in the welcome email
5. Once you have created your email signature, copy that and paste it in the email signature settings of your email
