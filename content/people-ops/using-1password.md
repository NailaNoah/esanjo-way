1Password remembers all your password for you. At Esanjo, we have a lot of applications that we use. A lot of applications = a lot of passwords to remember. Using 1Password allows each employee to remember just one master password.

## How to use 1Password:

1.      When your 1Password account is confirmed, log into https://esanjo.1password.com/ and sign in using your Esanjo email. Make sure to keep a copy of your emergency kit.

2.      Once signed in, you'll see your 1Password home page. In it, you will see all vaults that you have access to.

      ![1]

3.      When you click on “Personal Vault” you will be taken to a different page. This is where you should put your login details for each application or website that you use.

      ![2]

4.      Click on the "+" button on the bottom of the page. A menu will show up. Click on “Login”, if you're saving login details.

      ![5]

7.      Do the same procedure for the rest of your login details for different applications and don't forget to fill in the website link for each account

Alternatively, if you want to start securing your accounts by generating different passwords for each, you can use 1Password to generate a password. To do this:
