## Refer Talent to Esanjo

![1]

We're always on the look out for great talent and we've put together a nice scheme to reward any internal and external references who we end up hiring.

We'll pay $2000 for Engineering hires and $1000 for hires into other teams.

## External References
If you'd like to be part of our referral programme, fill in our beautiful [Referral Form][2] and upload your referralâ€™s CV. If we end up hiring them, we'll reach out and co-ordinate your reward.

As we're building a globally remote team, we're looking for amazing individuals anywhere in the world!

## Internal References
Please refer anyone that you think may be interested to [Careers][3] and drop a message to @aamir on Slack!

## The Fine Print
We pay out rewards once a hired individual has completed three months at Esanjo.
