## Refer Talent to Esanjo

[image][1]

We're always on the look out for great talent and we've put together a nice scheme to reward any internal and external references who we end up hiring.

We'll pay $2000 for Engineering hires and $1000 for hires into other teams.


## External References

If you want to be part of our bounty scheme it's simple, drop us an email with your reference candidate to this [email](job.929b5@esanjo.recruitee.com) and if we end up hiring your reference, we'll be in touch and coordinate the settlement.

As we're building a remote team, we're looking for amazing individuals from anywhere in the world!

## Internal References

Please refer anyone that you think may be interested to [Careers][2] and drop a message to Aamir!

## The Fine Print

We do settlements once the individual hired has completed three months with Esanjo. We'll be in touch once your reference has been successfully hired.
