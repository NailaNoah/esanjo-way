If you've been hired to work out of our HQ in Dubai, the most relevant operating entity will process an application for your UAE residence visa and your accompanying Emirates ID. You'll need to provide the following information to the Admin team:


**If you've been previously employed in the UAE:**

- An attested copy of your university degree or diploma
- Ten (10) passport sized photos with a white background
- Your original passport
- Your visa and work permit cancellation paperwork so that we can apply for a new work permit

**If you've been hired whilst you're on a visit visa or if you're outside the UAE:**

- An attested copy of your university degree or diploma
- Ten (10) passport sized photos with a white background
- Your original passport
- Your original visit visa (if you've got one)

The Admin team will aim to process your application as soon as they've got all of the above requirements.

Please keep in mind that you'll need to pass a medical before your visa and Emirates ID are issued. We generally will help with this process.

A typical visa application can take up to one (1) month.
