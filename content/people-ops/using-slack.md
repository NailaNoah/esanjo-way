Slack is Esanjo's internal communication chat application. We use Slack to communicate with each other, send documents, discuss work related issues or random things. Esanjo's Slack is set up in a way where each department has one public channel where we can discuss projects, work issues and ideas. This is the list of available channels and a brief decsription of each:

- **#admin**: this is where we discuss tasks and issues related to running the administration of Jadopado offices. This channel is connected to the Asana Admin team board.

- **#buyer-alerts**: the channel for buyer alerts.

- **#catalogue-alerts**: the channel for catalogue alerts.

- **#catalogue**: this is the catalogue team's public channel. A place to discuss our catalogue, categories and other related stuff.

## Tips for using Slack
1. Post messages related to your work in your department's public channel.
2. For personal conversations, send a direct message to the person on Slack. However, try to limit this and instead, walk up to your fellow ninja and have a face to face conversation! It's better that way!
3. Try to post your messages or share links on the correct channel
4. Always, try to discuss in public channels whenever possible
5. When you're not going to be in the office, please update the #whereabouts channel so that your fellow Esanjoers will know where you are.
