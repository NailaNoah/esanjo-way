The hiring process at Esanjo is pretty much the same as any other company. Depending on the role that a candidate applied for, the application process takes three to four stages.

We use [Recuritee][1] as our hiring software. It is a tool that has everything the People Operations needs from opening and publishing a role on the Esanjo career website, applicant tracking system and even social media integration, making it easier to find and recruit potential hires.

## The Stages of the Hiring Process

For different roles that are open, there are different stages that an applicant has to go through before getting the offer to join us. For engineering, operations & support and marketing related roles, these roles have 4 stages. These are:

**Phone Screen**

You'll know when you are on the first stage of the application process when you receive a phone call from the People Operations Specialist. This stage is a quick 5 to 10-minute call wherein the People Operations Specialist assess your communication skills, your interest in getting the role and a few background information that could be related to the required skills and qualifications of the role.


**Assessment**

The second stage is the assessment stage. For engineering roles, a technical assessment takes 3 to 5 days to complete. The other roles usually have assessment remotely that can be completed in under one hour.

**Interview**

If a candidate's submitted work during the assessment impressed the hiring team, then a candidate will immediately be scheduled for an interview. In this stage, a candidate will be asked the usual interview questions and the technical questions related to the job. Expect to be peppered with questions about previous work experience, skills and qualifications listed on the CV and a STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) question.

It is highly encouraged that a candidate should prepare by researching extensively before coming to an interview. We also like it when a candidate takes our work culture into consideration when dressing up for the interview.


**Final Interview**

The final interview is a sit down with our CEO or VP of Operations. It's usually a quick discussion and mostly touches base on all the things a candidate has discussed with the interview team during the initial interview.

For other roles, there are usually three stages excluding the assessment stage.


## Tips from the People Operations Specialist


1. When you're invited for an interview, make sure to come on time. If you're going to be late, we would appreciate it if you can let us know that you're running late. The team is usually okay with late applicants when an applicant informs us ahead of time.

2. One of our core values is, [Casual, But not informal][2] So try to be in smart casual clothes. Coming in a suit is not a plus point for us.

3. A plus point for us is when a candidate comes in prepared, researched about Esanjo, has read articles and news online about the company and brings samples of work relevant to the role.

4. The basic interview etiquettes are expected from a candidate. Please don't ask for the guest wifi password during the interview.
