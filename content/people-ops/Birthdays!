# Birthdays

One simple but powerful way to show the employees that you care, is to celebrate their birthdays!

No need to throw a big party, small gestures can have a big impact. All you need is Sugar Sugar….Make sure you find out what the employee likes — whether it’s chocolate chip cookies, peanut butter cups, or red velvet cake. A candy bag can be a good choice because employees can share it throughout the day.
 
## HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
