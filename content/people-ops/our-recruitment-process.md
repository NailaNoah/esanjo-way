#Our Recruitment Process

We post our current openings on our [career page] (https://careers.esanjo.com/) and the process is mostly online from there. Our job descriptions let you know what we expect for each position and link you to the individual application forms. The application form itself is self-explanatory - we ask you for your details, some position specific questions, and invite you to upload your CV. To make life easier there’s an option to apply via LinkedIn and Indeed. 

##The phone screen 

This is our preliminary screening. We call you and ask you some basic questions.

##The assessment test

Once you pass the phone screen you’ll be sent a position specific test to complete. We might send you some questions via Skype as well to answer whenever you’re free. 

##The interview 

This could be either physical or remote depending on your location. We’ll be asking you questions and we expect that you’ll have some for us as well. We’ll arrange the time and, if necessary, the location with you beforehand.

##The second interview 

If we really like you, you’ll be invited to a second interview; again this will be either physical or remote. This will be with our awesome CEO Omar who feels that it is incredibly important to meet prospective team members before inviting them into the Esanjo family.

##The offer 

We will let you know the great news by e-mail with your remuneration and start date.

##The contract 

As soon as you accept our offer, we’ll be sending you your contract so you can sign on the dotted line and seal the deal.

##Rejection

Unfortunately not everyone makes it but once you’ve reached phone screen and points beyond we do let you know at the very earliest if we’ve decided not to continue with your application.
