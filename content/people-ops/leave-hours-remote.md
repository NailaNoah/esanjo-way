## Unlimited Leave
We have an unlimited leave policy. Take as many days off as you want.

## Applying for Leave
Apply for leave using CakeHR. Your reporting manager will approve your leave on the basis of operational requirements.

## Sick Leave
See Unlimited Leave.

## Legalese
If you're based in the UAE, the UAE's labour law mandates that each individual is given thirty (30) days leave. If you sadly decide to leave the organisation, we unfortunately won't compensate you for any unused leave.

We also won't rollover any leave. The exception is our current financial year, if you've got any unused leave, this will rollover in its entirety and will become part of your unlimited leave.

## Public Holidays
If you're asked to work on a public holiday you will be paid an additional compensation multiplier of 0.75x on top of your compensation for that day.

## Working Hours
We practice a five day, 0900 to 1800 work week, but in reality we work as hard as we need to in order to get stuff done. Work hard, play harder.

## Flexible Hours & Working from Home
We think it is incredibly important to come into your closest Esanjo office (more coming soon!) and interact with your fellow Esanjoers. We do however, understand that everyone has lives to live and may need flexibility around work.

Flexible hours and working from home is an earned privilege. Once you've spent a few weeks at Esanjo, talk to your manager about turning this on.
