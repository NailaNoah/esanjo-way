The official office hours at Esanjo is from 9 AM to 6 PM. In Dubai, workdays are from Sunday to Thursday. While in Colombo, workdays are from Monday to Friday. Aside from the official work hours, each team at Esanjo have their own schedules to adhere to and each team have to take into consideration the ongoing projects and deadlines of the team before going off on leave. In cases where an employee needs to go on leave, we only ask that you do the following:

1. If you have plans to take time off on a certain date, always make sure that you've applied through Bamboo HR for the Flexible Leave Time Off. Once that's done, inform your immediate supervisor / lead that you have filed a flexible leave so that he or she knows about your application. That way, everyone in your team will be aware of your upcoming time off. See [Bamboo HR Guide][1] on how to submit a flexible leave request.

2. For emergencies and you need to be out of the office and can't work while away from the office, please inform your manager and give them a head's up. We only require that you update via the Slack channel #whereabouts so that anybody who might look for you will know that you're out of the office. Also, file for the day off in Bamboo HR as flexible time off when you finally get the chance to log into your Bamboo profile.

3. If you plan to go on a half-day leave, it is also required that you inform your manager, update #whereabouts and file a request on Bamboo HR.

4. If for some reason that you will be late to come into the office on a certain day, an update via #whereabouts will suffice with the time you expect to be in the office. The same goes with leaving the office earlier than the official office hours.

5. In instances where you are sick and can't work from home, please apply for flexible leave and put in the note that you're filing it as sick leave. This is for administrative records. You can either do it on the day you're sick or after you get better. Always make sure to update our Slack #whereabouts channel.
