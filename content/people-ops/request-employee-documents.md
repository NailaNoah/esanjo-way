An employee may have personal applications with numerous entities that will need certification from the company. These includes:

1. Salary certificate & No Objection Certificate for bank related applications.
2. Salary certificate & No Objection Certificate for visa applications.
3. Salary certificate & No Objection Certificate for government related applications.
4. Certificate of Employment confirming dates of employment of an employee after he or she has left the company.
5. Other confirmation letters or NOC related to an employee's employment with Esanjo.

If you're located in the Dubai HQ, there will be times when you need a No Objection Certificate for various applications that you may plan to take. (i.e: applying to study driving or applying to transfer your existing driver's license from your home country)

To request for any of the aforementioned documents, an employee only has to do the following:

1. Log into Asana
2. Click on the Admin team board
3. Click on [Employee Admin Request][1] project board
4. Add a task with the complete details that should be included in the letter or document that you're requesting from People Operations
5. Assign the task to the People Operations Specialist
6. Assign a due date on when you need the document so that People Ops can get right into preparing the document
7. Wait for the People Operations Specialist to give you the document
