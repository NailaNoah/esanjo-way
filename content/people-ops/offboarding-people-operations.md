These are the procedures in offboarding an employee in our Dubai HQ.

## When an employee is terminated:

Before offboarding, the employee's manager, a representative from People Operations and the employee will sit down and serve the notice of termination. Reasons for the termination will also be discussed. Once the discussion is done, People Operations will draw up a termination memo stating what was discussed and will get the employee to sign the memo. This is for People Operations employee records. Depending on what was discussed, the employee will start serving the notice period.

When the employee agrees that his last working day with the company will be during  same day he received his termination notice, the people operations specialist should immediately start the following process:

1. In Dubai, before the employee leaves the office, the following should be handed over to administration department:

  - Emirates ID
  - Medical Insurance card
  - The MacBook that was issued to the employee
  - If employee was issued a company phone and company SIM card, these should also be handed over

2. People Operations should disable employee's access to Esanjo email, Slack, 1Password and Bamboo HR.

3. Once Bamboo HR profile is deactivated, offboarding tasks should be added.

4. Depending on the agreement with management, the Administration team will process an employee's visa cancellation immediately or after a grace period.

5. People Operations Specialist should check with the lead of the employee if files are handed over or if the Google Drive should be transferred to another employee.

If an employee resigned, a notice period of one month is usually enforced. Once notice period is completed, the same offboarding process as specified for terminations should be followed on the employee's last working day.
