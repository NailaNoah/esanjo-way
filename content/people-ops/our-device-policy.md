On an employee's first day, part of the onboarding process is that the employee will be issued a MacBook Pro for work. Together with this MacBook is a form called Awesome Stuff For Work <!--- insert link for the form here --->. The employee will have to fill this out with the MacBook's specifications, serial number and other details. If another device (such as a magic mouse, keyboard and monitor) is issued, the employee should also put it in this form. Both the employee and his/her manager will sign this and give it back to People Operations.

This form is an acceptance of the employee that he/she will be responsible for all the items issued to him/her during the length of employment at Esanjo. Once an employee leaves, these items should be returned to the administration department in working condition.

An employee is expected to protect the issued machine to him/her and make sure that it's in good working order. In cases when issues show up, it should be reported immediately to the administration team to be checked and fixed before any major issues happens that can't be fixed.

If an accident happens and the MacBook is damaged, the employee is expected to shoulder the costs of getting the machine fixed. It is highly encouraged that the laptop issued and other devices are protected with cases or sleeves to prevent damage.

If the cause of the damage is a manufacturing defect or normal wear and tear, the employee will not be held liable and instead, Esanjo will handle getting this MacBook fixed for the employee. While the machine is being fixed, a spare laptop or device will be provided.
