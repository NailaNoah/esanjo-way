## Issues on flexible working hours, remote work and unlimited leave

There will be a time when an employee would repetitively miss showing up for work, be it remotely or at both Esanjo offices. When this behaviour affects the team's productivity and morale, the lead or reporting manager's next step should be to inform People Operations.

The lead will have to inform People Operations about the employee's frequent absence and what's the effect on the entire team.  After that, the lead will have to have a chat with said employee and inform him/her about the issue. The lead will then have to get an affirmation that said Esanjo employee will refrain from showing up at work.

The second instance of the same issue will be put into a written memo with clear performance improvement plan for said employee. The employee will have to work on improving his or her attendance and work performance aligned with the set performance improvement plan laid out by the team manager.

When all the aforementioned mitigating steps are done and still, the employee fails to comply, the third and final warning will be given by the People Operations team together with a written memo. At this stage, the employee may be terminated immediately at the discretion of management.


## Work-related issues due to an employee's health issue

This is what all those involved should do in instances that an employee's health is making an impact on his working capabilities.

1. The employee should talk to his manager about his or her health issue and also inform the People Operations Specialist.

2. If rest is required by the attending doctor of the employee, flexible leave should be applied by the employee and include the reasons for the flexible leave application. That is when he's able bodied to do so. In case he or she's not available to file it, People Operations can do it on behalf of the employee.

3. In cases where the employee needs additional flexible leave days, he or she should reach out to People Operations and discuss the additional flexible leave days.

4. Discussions about an employee's options at this point will have to be done between the leadership, People Operations and an employee's manager.
