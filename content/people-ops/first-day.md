## There are a couple of things that you need to do on your first day:


1. Update your Bamboo HR profile's photo, add your residential address and add your emergency contacts.
2. If you are reporting to the Dubai HQ, make sure you have given the administration team a copy of your IDs such as passport and if you have one, your Emirates ID. You also need to bring 10 copies of a passport-sized photo with white background.
3. If you are going to be located in the Colombo office, the administration team will make sure to scan a copy of your National ID for our records, so make sure you hand it over to Admin in Colombo.
4. If you're in Dubai, the administration team will make sure that you're up to speed on the process of getting you a work permit, a residential visa stamped on your passport and your Emirates ID. You can also check [here][1] to have an idea on what to bring for the admin team to get started in processing your documents.
5. Check out the Esanjo team page [here][2] to see who's from which office and what they do.
6. Don't be shy to send a direct message to people and say hi! Better yet, don't be shy and approach everyone and say hi! üòâ

## Esanjo Traditions

In Esanjo, we have a few traditions and it always includes food. It's almost always üçï! When you feel like celebrating a personal or professional achievement with your Esanjo colleagues, we highly encourage that treats be brought for everyone. It can be in the form of Krispy Kreme donuts Dunkin' Donuts or Gonuts Donuts (if you're in Colombo). Any kind of food is accepted so long as you're comfortable and willing to buy it for everyone.

New employees who are getting their first full month salary is expected to buy donuts for everyone. Don't fret too much if you don't want to continue traditions, it's okay we won't judge. üòä

Employees who are celebrating their birthdays can buy lunch for everyone to celebrate. Again, it is not mandatory and no one will hate you for not buying us lunch.

To cap off a (hopefully) very productive week, you can look forward to Ice cream Thursdays in the Dubai office and Ice cream Fridays in the Colombo office. üç¶
